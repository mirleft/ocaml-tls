(* Fuzz testing for tls-eio.

   This code picks two random strings, one for the client to send and one for
   the server. It then starts a send and receive fiber for each end.

   A dispatcher fiber then sends commands to these worker fibers
   (see [action] for the possible actions).

   This is intended to check for bugs in the Eio wrapper (rather than in Tls itself).
   At the moment, it's just checking that tls-eio works when used correctly.
   Each endpoint overlaps reads with writes (but not reads with other reads or
   writes with other writes).

   Some possible future improvements:

   - It currently only checks the basic read/write/close operations.
     It should be extended to check [reneg], etc too.

   - Currently, cancelling a read operation marks the Tls flow as broken.
     We should allow resuming after a cancelled read, and test that here.

   - We should try injecting faults and make sure they're handled sensibly.

   - It would be good to get coverage reports for these tests.
     However, this requires changes to crowbar:
     https://github.com/stedolan/crowbar/issues/4#issuecomment-1310277551
     (a patched version reported 54% coverage of Tls_eio.ml) *)
