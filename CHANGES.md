  checking fingerprints of certificates instead of trusting trust
  anchors #206 #207
* client configuration requires an authenticator #202

0.2.0 (2014-10-30):
* distinguish between supported hash and mac algorithms (using Nocrypto.Hash)
  and those which may occur on the wire #189
* expose trust anchor when authenticating the certificate (requires x509 >= 0.2) #178
* information about the active session is exposed via epoch : state -> epoch
* distinguish between supported ciphersuites (type ciphersuite) and
  known ciphersuites (type any_ciphersuite) #173
* distinguish between supported versions by the stack (type tls_version)
  and readable versions (tls_any_version), which might occur in a tls
  record or client_hello read from the network #179 #172
* support > TLS-1.2 client hellos (as reported by ssllabs.com #161)
* support iOS 6 devices (who propose NULL ciphers - reported in #160)
